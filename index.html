        <h2>The Snowy Mountaintops</h2>
        <p>The mountains are Earth's mightiest beings, as unmovable as they are beautiful. Although they aren't perfect, the jagged edges and corners of these beasts are what shape them into perfection. This woman who stands on the rock near the water, she is captivated in a way that truly brings out the beauty of the mountains, rocks, and water. It gives them that extra boost of life.</p>

        <h2>The Mind of Beauty</h2>
        <p>Ever stroll into a shallow forest one day and just find that perfect spot? This image represents that feeling when kids find that special place in the forest and it turns into their special hideout. What a beautiful thing, to see this forest for the first time with the mind of a little kid. I doubt anyone older would appreciate this secluded spot's beauty. </p>

        <h2>The Void that Captivates</h2> 
        <p>Although this image doesn't provide much to look at, this liminal space brings out a sense of relaxation in the viewer. It gives a sense of peace, knowing that the person is all alone to enjoy this beauty. The grass, the grasshills, the road to the unknown, where do they all go? That is a question that the viewer must answer for themselves.</p>
